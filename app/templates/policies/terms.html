      <p>Placing an order confirms agreement to pricing, lead times, and personalization options approved during checkout or the custom process.</p>
      <p>Payment is captured via Stripe at checkout. Custom invoices require a 50% deposit to begin and the balance prior to delivery.</p>
      <p>We reserve the right to decline commissions that conflict with our brand values or timeline capacity.</p>
      <p>All pieces remain property of Samâ€™s Nik Naks until paid in full. Photos of completed work may be shared in our portfolio unless you request otherwise.</p>
